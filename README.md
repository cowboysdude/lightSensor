Create an ESPHOME Light level sensor


First off this isn't created it's a modified design that ResinChemTech made which is an all purpose excellent sensor... I only needed the light level part of the entire sensor so I modified it and here it is....

Thank you for all your excellent work!!

I needed a simple light level sensor for some automations...  Yes you could use the sun but for instance if it's a poor weather day and you need lights on?  Why not use a light level sensor so no  matter
what time of day or night if it's dark you can have lights, isn't that the idea of an 'automation' LOL !!

So what's here?
The STL for the case
instructions 
and bin file to burn to your D1 Mini

I use these:

## The D1 Mini

## Ajustable light sensor

## The Code
Included are the STL for the case and the bin file to use in ESPHome [which you can modify for your needs!] as well as an automation example...

The hardware you can get on Amazon, Aliexpress or just about anywhere they are both inexpensive and easy to get!

Create your sensor inside of ESPHome.... using the included bin file... you can modify it as you wish to suit your needs!!

## These are the readings that this sensor provides:
