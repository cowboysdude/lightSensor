Create an ESPHOME Light level sensor


First off this isn't created it's a modified design that ResinChemTech made which is an all purpose excellent sensor... I only needed the light level part of the entire sensor so I modified it and here it is....
This was modified from https://resinchemtech.blogspot.com/2022/10/a-new-multisensor.html
Thank you for all your excellent work!!

I needed a simple light level sensor for some automations...  Yes you could use the sun but for instance if it's a poor weather day and you need lights on?  Why not use a light level sensor so no  matter
what time of day or night it is you can call you lights!!

So what's here?
The STL for the case
instructions 
and bin file to burn to your D1 Mini

I use these:
[D1 from Amazon]([actual URL to navigate](https://www.amazon.com/HiLetgo-NodeMcu-Development-ESP8266-Compatiable/dp/B073CQVFLK/ref=sxts_b2b_sx_reorder_acb_customer?content-id=amzn1.sym.6fdb3e96-ead3-40f8-a3bc-e83a8d332951%3Aamzn1.sym.6fdb3e96-ead3-40f8-a3bc-e83a8d332951&cv_ct_cx=wemos+d1+mini&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.eCQ-O9tr_VbIIt8icM8_og.UfR4ndj5_NN3NjUxCgF6rxb5AyA52Ikj489ZW_zQRyI&dib_tag=se&keywords=wemos+d1+mini&pd_rd_i=B073CQVFLK&pd_rd_r=ad955f94-5dda-45de-8e8b-95ae296f4c4f&pd_rd_w=csDvM&pd_rd_wg=W5mzA&pf_rd_p=6fdb3e96-ead3-40f8-a3bc-e83a8d332951&pf_rd_r=7VY7K6WYGFBV6Y9FRW9Y&qid=1713141674&sbo=RZvfv%2F%2FHxDF%2BO5021pAnSA%3D%3D&sr=1-1-62d64017-76a9-4f2a-8002-d7ec97456eea))

This is very simple and easy!!  

Create your sensor inside of ESPHome.... using the included bin file... you can modify it as you wish to suit your needs!!
